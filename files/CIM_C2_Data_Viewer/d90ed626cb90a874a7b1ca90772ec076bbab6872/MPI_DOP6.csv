Thoughts;"Focused on the action
Focused on matching my movements with her movements and intentions
Imagining her movements
Specifically concerned about moment she takes her shoes off, which I want to capture. And how to go back up to her face after.
[As it requires a complicated movement]";;"When down on the shoes, moment of doubt about when to go up

Anticipating her reaction to male appearing

Knowing next action I want to catch is him putting shoes on the table.";;"I don’t want to catch him picking up the shoes

I want to catch him putting shoes on table";"Okay, now I need to rotate to her back and do it in a way that feels organic with her movements
So I can pan down and catch him putting the shoes on the table
Wanting to catch the flare from the window light
Wanting to use the verticality of the window to show division between them
In the back of his mind are religious/symbolic  imagery/ themes/ geometry
Knowing it is going to be tricky with the space as I block her
Deciding to still do it
Knowing/trusting she will solve it professionally as actress";"Waiting for important line ""Your friends don't like me""
Just waiting for that action of the line, muting the content of the sentence

I could be on him, but I want to be with her and see how he is approaching";"Not very planned
Keeping possibiities open, also in terms of distance
I know I am between closeup and midshot and that I am going to be between proile and 3/4 frontal of her and also want to be on him, (so I am reacting to that)
Not thinking that I am only going to be on her
Seeing, what is their connection?
Starting to explore how to end the shoot
And getting ready for closing part of scene.

";;"Realising they have an agreement or indication

I will try to reinforce this action"
Other mental processes / states;"Visualising, like previewing, looking at the space, imagining her movements in it

Trying to imagine how the object is going to be in the frame, what lines I will see in background, what I will see in background and foreground";Trying to be alert, ready;Knowing her picking up the shoes is coming;;;"Realising I am blocking her as I take long step back
Very alert of the frame to catch a religious theme in the geometry, giving the light flare a toxic meaning, representing his power";Main focus is to keep them on frame;"Seeing, what is their connection?
Discovering things (by relaxing in the body and keeping a flow of movement, and keeping moving)
Still very alert, even more in this flow state [because I have to be responsive]
Completely invested in the present, what is happening in the frame. Just-past and planning next are not present
More concerned with having them on frame correctly under my rules of composition, than with their expressions. ";"No surprise [it happens all the time, not surprising in itself]

Focused on composition";My concentration breaks a little [perhaps by persona of actor appearing, or the geometry]
Feelings / emotions;;;Immediately when she comes in, I feel it works;;;"Feeling her confusion for a moment
I feel she is acknowledging my presence with her body";;"Feeling good
Feeling excited to discover new possibilities of a scene
";Didn't feel that much;"Did not feel surprise

I feel I have to take distance from them"
Body actions, sensations, events;"Rehearsing my movements
Imagining how it feels, the movements I would do, how low I would go with camera
Feeling where my elbows touch my stomach, so I know this is the limit
Physically making movements to the window
Deliberately hitting the table so body knows this is the limit";Trying to be comfortable in the body;;;I am physically very close to her;Realising I am blocking her as I take long step back;;"Sense of flowing, keeping in movement, also in how I move the camera
I feel it all around the body, trying to relax all muscles, the knees, the stepping, the hips, moving a little from side to side, in an out";;Body translates surprise by stepping back, it is a bit like their looking pushes me back
Actions (decisive, filming);Exploring with the viewfinder, what I can see, and what I can see with my eyes;;"Starting to move at same time as her, following her
Going very fast down with her picking up the shoes
When nothing else is happening down with the shoes, going up to her face
Trying to go more of a profile of her in order to take her reaction when male comes in";Capturing her moving to window while moving with her, catching her response up close when he enters;I am physically very close to her;"As I rotate, I take one long step back [as I want to catch the light from the window to create a flare]

Playing around with the light and the division the window can give between them";"Catching him putting down the shoes on the table
All the while moving, turning with her, and stepping back, giving them back their space
Keeping moving towards closeup twoshot he wants to take when she delivers line
Reacting to their actions
Keeping them on frame";"Rotating from the corner to have them together already in similar position of the ending
Moving back and forth
Panning alternatively between him and her

More freestyling from this moment on
Playing a little with the action, not very planned, reacting to what I see

(I know I am between closeup and midshot and that I am going to be between proile and 3/4 frontal of her and also want to be on him,) so I am reacting to that

Letting things open, also in terms of distance";;Deciding to take a couple of steps back, matching their action and that distance the looking at the camera represents
